## Background

- ACL is the most important venue for presenting new NLP research.
  - There are several other high-quality conferences, but ACL is the most prestigious.
- Although the name is "Association for Computational Linguistics", the focus is really NLP, not CL.
  - These communities overlap very strongly, but there is a difference in emphasis.
  - CL uses computational tools to better understanding how language works (science).
  - NLP is about building systems that can perform tasks involving language (engineering).

## Overall impressions

- Conference website: [http://acl2016.org/](http://acl2016.org/)
- 1,600 attendees -- the biggest ACL ever
- 231 long papers, 97 short papers
- Six (sometimes even seven!) parallel tracks
- I attended almost 40 talks -- full raw notes [here](2016-ACL-notes.txt)
- Stanford NLP dominated the conference -- 12(?) papers
- The pace of evolution of NLP is faster than ever
- Approaches based on neural networks have become ubiquitous

Abstract:  
Tree-structured neural networks exploit valuable syntactic parse information as they interpret the meanings of sentences.  However, they suffer from two key technical problems that make them slow and unwieldy for large-scale NLP tasks: they usually operate on parsed sentences and they do not directly support batched computation.  We address these issues by introducing the Stack-augmented Parser-Interpreter Neural Network (SPINN), which combines parsing and interpretation within a single tree-sequence hybrid model by integrating tree-structured sentence interpretation into the linear sequential structure of a shift-reduce parser. Our model supports batched computation for a speedup of up to 25x over other tree-structured models, and its integrated parser can operate on unparsed data with little loss in accuracy. We evaluate it on the Stanford NLI entailment task and show that it significantly outperforms other sentence-encoding models.


    sentence encoders in supervised learning
    common sentence encoders: sum of word embeddings, RNNs, CNNs, TreeRNNs

![SPINN-1.png](SPINN-1.png)

    TreeRNNs, how they work
      pro: theoretically appealing, empirically competitive
      con: relies on external parser, and slow -- don't support batch computation
      conventional RNNs can be computed far more efficiently on GPUs due to batched computation

    SPINN: Shift-reduce parser interpreter NN
      equaivalent to TreeRNN, but way faster, and doesn't require external parser
      key idea: mapping from binary tree to transition sequences (transition-based parsing)
        sequence of shift/reduce operations

![SPINN-2.png](SPINN-2.png)

    context-sensitive composition
    the model sees a low-dimensional summary of the left context
    this is produced by the "tracking LSTM"
      inputs: head of stack, head of buffer
    integrated parser: two-way transition classifier, emits shift or reduce, informed by tracking LSTM

![SPINN-3.png](SPINN-3.png)

    implementing the stack -- how to do it in NN?
    naive: simulate with fixed-size array
    requires lots of inefficient copying
    thinner stack: store only head of stack [huh? are we actually losing information? don't get it]

A Thorough Examination of the CNN/Daily Mail Reading Comprehension Task  
Danqi Chen, Jason Bolton and Christopher D. Manning  
[https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1223.pdf](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1223.pdf)


Abstract:  

Enabling a computer to understand a document so that it can answer comprehension questions is a central, yet unsolved goal of NLP. A key factor impeding its solution by machine learned systems is the limited availability of human-annotated data.  Hermann et al. (2015) seek to solve this problem by creating over a million training examples by pairing CNN and Daily Mail news articles with their summarized bullet points, and show that a neural network can then be trained to give good performance on this task. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of this new reading comprehension task. Our primary aim is to understand what depth of language understanding is required to do well on this task. We approach this from one side by doing a careful hand-analysis of a small subset of the problems and from the other by showing that simple, carefully designed systems can obtain accuracies of 72.4% and 75.8% on these two datasets, exceeding current state-of-the-art results by over 5% and approaching what we believe is the ceiling for performance on this task.


#### The task and the datasets

    reading comprehension: passage (P) + question (Q) => answer (A)
    data is a bottleneck
    existing datasets very small
    last year, DeepMind (Hermann et al. 2015) created a very large dataset from CNN/Daily Mail
    ~1M examples

![danqi-1.png](danqi-1.png)

![danqi-2.png](danqi-2.png)

    this paper
    lower bound: simple systems work surprisingly well on this dataset
    upper bound: manual analysis indicates that we are almost done -- this task is not that hard!

#### Establishing stronger baselines with simple models

    system 1: simple entity-centric classifier with manually-engineered features
      for each entity, build vector of very simple features
    system 2: end-to-end NN: bi-RNN w/ attention -- nowadays a pretty standard architecture

![danqi-3.png](danqi-3.png)

![danqi-4.png](danqi-4.png)

    results
      baselines: Hermann et al. 2015 (DeepMind), Hill et al. 2016 (Facebook)
      our simple classifier matches best previous results
      our NN does even better
      ensemble of the two does even better! 77% accuracy

![danqi-5.png](danqi-5.png)

    why do we get much better results than DeepMind's attentive reader?
      bilinear attention
      remove a redundant layer before prediction
      predict among entities only, not all words

#### Assessing headroom via manual analysis

    upper bound
    do ablation analysis of our simple classifier
      most important feature is n-gram match, followed by frequency
    manual breakdown of examples into six categories
      exact match, paraphrasing, partial clue, multiple sentences, coreference error, ambiguous/hard
      the last two categories are going to be very hard to get, but constitute 25% of examples
      we're already at 77% performance -- already close to ceiling

![danqi-6.png](danqi-6.png)

    takeaways
      simple models sometimes just work
      NNs great for learning semantic matches
      dataset is large, but still noisy, not hard enough for reasoning and inference
      more datasets coming: WikiReading, LAMBADA, SQuAD
      it's an exciting time for reading comprehension!

WikiReading: A Novel Large-scale Language Understanding Task over Wikipedia  
Daniel Hewlett, Alexandre Lacoste, Llion Jones, Illia Polosukhin, Andrew Fandrianto, Jay Han, Matthew Kelcey and David Berthelot  
[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1145.pdf](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1145.pdf)

Abstract:  
We present WIKIREADING, a large-scale natural language understanding task and publicly-available dataset with 18 million instances. The task is to predict textual values from the structured knowledge base Wikidata by reading the text of the corresponding Wikipedia articles. The task contains a rich variety of challenging classification and extraction sub-tasks, making it well-suited for end-to-end models such as deep neural networks (DNNs).  We compare various state-of-the-art DNN-based architectures for document classification, information extraction, and question answering. We find that models supporting a rich answer space, such as word or character sequences, perform best. Our best-performing model, a word-level sequence-to-sequence model with a mechanism to copy out-of-vocabulary words, obtains an accuracy of 71.8%.

    a dataset for evaluating deep learning models for QA
    factoid-style QA as end-to-end optimization
    want to evaluate in a shared way
    models like this benefit from very large datasets
    there is no perfect dataset

    example
    wiki page for barack obama
    wikidata entry
    wikidata: crowdsourced KB, similar to Freebase, but aligned to wikipedia
      properties and values
    each task instance
      raw text from wikipedia article
      property is question
      value is answer
    two kinds: categorical properties, limited set of values, a classification task
      e.g. gender, country of origin
      evidence is often distributed over the text, like a text cat problem
    also relational properties: dates, names, places
      evidence is extracted from a single point in text, like an IE problem

![WikiReading-1.png](WikiReading-1.png)

    dataset statistics
      18.5M instances
      900 unique properties
      perhaps less varied than other datasets
      but much larger
    scoring metric
      mean F1: compute F1 per problem, then average over problems
      this is a way of giving partial credit for set-based answers

    approaches to QA -- what works best?
    tried a variety of approaches, incl. recent DNN work, also textcat

    eval setup in TensorFlow
    fixed hyperparameters like vocab size

    approaches
      classification -- for textcat problems
      labeling / pointing -- for extraction problems -- label each word in doc as part of answer or not
      seq2seq -- encode doc and question, decode the answer as seq of words or chars

    results for a range of models
    best results from "attentive reader" by Hermann et al. 2015
    broadly, models with RNNs and attention do best

![WikiReading-3.png](WikiReading-3.png)

    seq2seq models
    rare word copying -- similar to MT, Luong et al. 2015
    word-level vs. char level: char-level permits OOV generation, but seqs are very long
    overall, seq2seq models perform best
      handles categorical tasks as well as classifiers
      handles relational tasks as well as labelers
      and actually uses fewer parameters

    future work
      still lots of headroom on performance
      char-level seq2seq especially promising
      multilingual: dataset generation could easily be done in other languages

    really nice work!
    exceptionally clear presentation!

Learning Language Games through Interaction  
Sida I. Wang, Percy Liang and Christopher D. Manning  
[https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1224.pdf](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1224.pdf)


Abstract:  
We introduce a new language learning setting relevant to building adaptive natural language interfaces. It is inspired by Wittgensteinâs language games: a human wishes to accomplish some task (e.g., achieving a certain configuration of blocks), but can only communicate with a computer, who performs the actual actions (e.g., removing all red blocks). The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computerâs capabilities.  We created a game called SHRDLURN in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humansâ strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance.  Second, we compare computer strategies, showing that modeling pragmatics on a semantic parsing model accelerates learning for more strategic players.


Code, data, __demo__ online:  
[http://shrdlurn.sidaw.xyz](http://shrdlurn.sidaw.xyz)

    natural language interfaces: SIri, Cortana, Google Now, Alexa
    NLI wishlist
      interactive learning -- feedback from users
      adapt to users
      handle special domains and low resource languages

    language game -- Wittgenstein
      language derives its meaning from use
    interactive language game
      human player has goal, cannot perform actions
      computer player does not know goal, can performa actions, does not understand the language

    SHRDLURN
      blocks world
      starting configuration, goal
      "remove red"
      computer responds with ordered list of actions
      human provides feedback by choosing correct action
      "remove right red"
      built a nice UI for this

![shrdlurn-1.png](shrdlurn-1.png)

    computer: semantic parsing
    actions as logical forms
    fairly standard approach to semantic parsing
      log-linear model, L1 penalty, AdaGrad
      very generic features: uni-, bi-, skip-grams; tree-grams, cross-product features

    humans: 100 MTurkers
    10K utterances (6 hours)
    minimal instructions
    can use any language
    examples
      some invented their own shortahnd language
      some were inconsistent, performed poorly
      most used English, but one used Polish, one used RPN!
      became more consistent, more concise over time
      learning works fairly well, esp. for top players

![shrdlurn-3.png](shrdlurn-3.png)

    pragmatics
      say you teach the computer the meaning of one word
      if you then use a different word, pragmatics suggests that you mean a different thing
      otherwise you should have just used the same word
      humans do this without thinking
      reminiscent of work from Will Monroe and Chris Potts
      but adding pragmatics had relatively little impact on quantitative results overall
      however that includes crappy players
      if you focus only on the top players, it does help a lot!

    takeaways
      more capable and responsive to users
      feedback mechanism => less likely to be stuck
      good for low-resource languages and new domains
      learn from the actual distribution

_The Enemy in Your Own Camp: How Well Can We Detect Statistically-Generated Fake Reviews -- An Adversarial Study_  
Dirk Hovy  
[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2057.pdf](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2057.pdf)

Abstract:  
Online reviews are a growing market, but it is struggling with fake reviews. They undermine both the value of reviews to the user, and their trust in the review sites.  However, fake positive reviews can boost a business, and so a small industry producing fake reviews has developed. The two sides are facing an arms race that involves more and more natural language processing (NLP). So far, NLP has been used mostly for detection, and works well on human-generated reviews. But what happens if NLP techniques are used to generate fake reviews as well? We investigate the question in an adversarial setup, by assessing the detectability of different fake-review generation strategies. We use generative models to produce reviews based on meta-information, and evaluate their effectiveness against deceptiondetection models and human judges. We find that meta-information helps detection, but that NLP-generated reviews conditioned on such information are also much harder to detect than conventional ones.


Somebody stole Dirk's laptop, so he had to present without slides! Kicking it old-school! Heroic!

![Dirk Hovy](IMG_1727.JPG)

    lots of reviews -- Yelp, Trip Advisor
    a multi-billion dollar industry
    problem of fake reviews
    companies are using NLP to identify fake reviews
    we're actually able to do this pretty well
    fake reviewers are lazy
    too many adjectives
    can use a logistic regression model pretty well
    if we can detect fake reviews using NLP, can we make fake reviews using NLP
    7-gram Markov model works really well
    now, can we detect those?
    turns out that fake detectors also use metadata extensively -- age, gender
    so to make good fakes, you have to fake the metadata too
    a generative model for that
    adversarial setup
    how well can NLP tools fool NLP tools
    if you don't generate fake metadata, the LR model can discriminate the fakes
    but if you do, it can't distinguish the fakes!
    how well do humans do? terrible -- worse than logistic regression models
    so this is how you can get rich quick

Deep multi-task learning with low level tasks supervised at lower layers  
Anders SÃ¸gaard and Yoav Goldberg  
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2038.pdf

Abstract:  
In all previous work on deep multi-task learning we are aware of, all task supervisions are on the same (outermost) layer.  We present a multi-task learning architecture with deep bi-directional RNNs, where different tasks supervision can happen at different layers. We present experiments in syntactic chunking and CCG supertagging, coupled with the additional task of POS-tagging. We show that it is consistently better to have POS supervision at the innermost rather than the outermost layer. We argue that this is because âlow-levelâ tasks are better kept at the lower layers, enabling the higher-level tasks to make use of the shared representation of the lower-level tasks. Finally, we also show how this architecture can be used for domain adaptation.


    bi-LSTM models
    input layer: pretrained embeddings
    output layers: syntactic chunking, or POS tagging (multi-task learning)
    during training, we randomly sample from the two datasets, then randomly sample an example

    three perspectives on multi-task learning
    1 semi-supervised learning
        auxiliary data is enriched unlabeled data
    2 representation learning
        auxiliary data is used to learn representations that are useful for target task
    3 regularization
        auxiliary data is an adaptive prior

    inspiration: face recognition, preogressively more complex repns at higher layers
    idea: use POS data to supervise at lower layers, not top layer
    instead of supervising with either POS or syntax at top output layer

    experiments
    baseline vs. vanilla MTL vs cascaded
    yes, cascaded helps!

    more experiments
    domain adaptation
    assume we have POS-annotated data for target domain, but not SYN-annotated data
    here the effect is even more pronounced

    MTL as regularization
    is supervision at lower layers more prone to overfitting?
    no, in fact it is less vulnerable to overfitting than baseline or vanilla MTL

    take home messages
    MTL is cool
    NNs provide a convenient framework for MTL
    but think about your architectures

Finding Non-Arbitrary Form-Meaning Systematicity Using String-Metric Learning for Kernel Regression  
E. Dario Gutierrez, Roger Levy and Benjamin Bergen  
[https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1225.pdf](https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1225.pdf)

Abstract:  
Arbitrariness of the sign â the notion that the forms of words are unrelated to their meanings â is an underlying assumption of many linguistic theories. Two lines of research have recently challenged this assumption, but they produce differing characterizations of non-arbitrariness in language.  Behavioral and corpus studies have confirmed the validity of localized form-meaning patterns manifested in limited subsets of the lexicon. Meanwhile, global (lexicon-wide) statistical analyses instead find diffuse form-meaning systematicity across the lexicon as a whole.  We bridge the gap with an approach that can detect both local and global form-meaning systematicity in language. In the kernel regression formulation we introduce, form-meaning relationships can be used to predict wordsâ distributional semantic vectors from their forms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel metric learning algorithm that can learn weighted edit distances that minimize kernel regression error. Our results suggest that the English lexicon exhibits far more global form-meaning systematicity than previously discovered, and that much of this systematicity is focused in localized form-meaning patterns.


#### My raw notes

    arbitrariness of the sign
    assumption: the relationship between forms and meanings is arbitrary
    but is it so?

    systematicity in the lexicon
    sub-morphemic form-mean mappings
      buzz, clink, clank
      gl: gleam, glow, glimmer, glint, glance, glare, glisten, glitter, ...
      sn: snark, sneeze, sniff, snicker, ...
      sl: slide, slick, sled
    identified intuitively
    confirmed empirically
    but relies on testing specific hypotheses
    can we automate this?
    can we study systematicity globally?
    maybe these are just statistically flukes?
    how broadly distributed over the lexicon?

    let's use distributional semantics to study systematicity over the whole lexicon
    Shillock & Kirby 2001
      over all pairs of words, measure correlation between form distances and meaning distances
      the correlation is small in magnitude, but highly statistically significant
    Monaghan et al. 2014 -- found no difference from chance
    how to reconcile?
    maybe previous work is not sensitive enough
      only capture linear relationships
      treat all types of edits as equivalent

    can we learn a model from string space into semantic space?
      SMLKR model
      i.e. try to predict meaning from form?
      kernel regression -- non-parametric regression -- locally smooth
      metric learning for kernel regression
      parametrization of edit distance function space
      optimization

    experiments
      40,000 words, most frequent in BNC corpus
      found highly statistically significant structure
      most systematic: gurgle, tingle, hoop, chink, swirl, ladle, ...

![gutierrez-1.png](gutierrez-1.png)

    behavioral evaluation
      asked humans how well form corresponds to meaning
      judgments correlate with predictions of SMLKR model

    systematicity is significantly localized
