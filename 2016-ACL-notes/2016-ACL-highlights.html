<h2>Background</h2>

<ul>
<li>ACL is the most important venue for presenting new NLP research.
<ul>
<li>There are several other high-quality conferences, but ACL is the most prestigious.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Although the name is "Association for Computational Linguistics", the focus is really NLP, not CL.
<ul>
<li>These communities overlap very strongly, but there is a difference in emphasis.</li>
<li>CL uses computational tools to better understanding how language works (science).</li>
<li>NLP is about building systems that can perform tasks involving language (engineering).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Overall impressions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Conference website: <a href="http://acl2016.org/">http://acl2016.org/</a></li>
<li>1,600 attendees -- the biggest ACL ever</li>
<li>231 long papers, 97 short papers</li>
<li>Six (sometimes even seven!) parallel tracks</li>
<li>I attended almost 40 talks -- full raw notes <a href="2016-ACL-notes.txt">here</a></li>
<li>Stanford NLP dominated the conference -- 12(?) papers</li>

<p>A Fast Unified Model for Parsing and Sentence Understanding <br />

<p>Abstract: <br />
Tree-structured neural networks exploit valuable syntactic parse information as they interpret the meanings of sentences.  However, they suffer from two key technical problems that make them slow and unwieldy for large-scale NLP tasks: they usually operate on parsed sentences and they do not directly support batched computation.  We address these issues by introducing the Stack-augmented Parser-Interpreter Neural Network (SPINN), which combines parsing and interpretation within a single tree-sequence hybrid model by integrating tree-structured sentence interpretation into the linear sequential structure of a shift-reduce parser. Our model supports batched computation for a speedup of up to 25x over other tree-structured models, and its integrated parser can operate on unparsed data with little loss in accuracy. We evaluate it on the Stanford NLI entailment task and show that it significantly outperforms other sentence-encoding models.</p>

<p>Abstract: <br />
We present WIKIREADING, a large-scale natural language understanding task and publicly-available dataset with 18 million instances. The task is to predict textual values from the structured knowledge base Wikidata by reading the text of the corresponding Wikipedia articles. The task contains a rich variety of challenging classification and extraction sub-tasks, making it well-suited for end-to-end models such as deep neural networks (DNNs).  We compare various state-of-the-art DNN-based architectures for document classification, information extraction, and question answering. We find that models supporting a rich answer space, such as word or character sequences, perform best. Our best-performing model, a word-level sequence-to-sequence model with a mechanism to copy out-of-vocabulary words, obtains an accuracy of 71.8%.</p>

<pre><code>a dataset for evaluating deep learning models for QA
factoid-style QA as end-to-end optimization
want to evaluate in a shared way
models like this benefit from very large datasets
there is no perfect dataset

example
wiki page for barack obama
wikidata entry
wikidata: crowdsourced KB, similar to Freebase, but aligned to wikipedia
  properties and values
each task instance
  raw text from wikipedia article
  property is question
  value is answer
two kinds: categorical properties, limited set of values, a classification task
  e.g. gender, country of origin
  evidence is often distributed over the text, like a text cat problem
also relational properties: dates, names, places
  evidence is extracted from a single point in text, like an IE problem
</code></pre>

<p><img src="WikiReading-1.png" alt="WikiReading-1.png" title="" /></p>

<pre><code>dataset statistics
  18.5M instances
  900 unique properties
  perhaps less varied than other datasets
  but much larger
scoring metric
  mean F1: compute F1 per problem, then average over problems
  this is a way of giving partial credit for set-based answers

approaches to QA -- what works best?
tried a variety of approaches, incl. recent DNN work, also textcat

eval setup in TensorFlow
fixed hyperparameters like vocab size

approaches
  classification -- for textcat problems
  labeling / pointing -- for extraction problems -- label each word in doc as part of answer or not
  seq2seq -- encode doc and question, decode the answer as seq of words or chars

results for a range of models
best results from "attentive reader" by Hermann et al. 2015
broadly, models with RNNs and attention do best
</code></pre>

<p><img src="WikiReading-3.png" alt="WikiReading-3.png" title="" /></p>

<pre><code>seq2seq models
rare word copying -- similar to MT, Luong et al. 2015
word-level vs. char level: char-level permits OOV generation, but seqs are very long
overall, seq2seq models perform best
  handles categorical tasks as well as classifiers
  handles relational tasks as well as labelers
  and actually uses fewer parameters

future work
  still lots of headroom on performance
  char-level seq2seq especially promising
  multilingual: dataset generation could easily be done in other languages

really nice work!
exceptionally clear presentation!

<p>A Thorough Examination of the CNN/Daily Mail Reading Comprehension Task <br />
Danqi Chen, Jason Bolton and Christopher D. Manning <br />
<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1223.pdf">https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1223.pdf</a></p>

<p>Abstract:  </p>

<p>Enabling a computer to understand a document so that it can answer comprehension questions is a central, yet unsolved goal of NLP. A key factor impeding its solution by machine learned systems is the limited availability of human-annotated data.  Hermann et al. (2015) seek to solve this problem by creating over a million training examples by pairing CNN and Daily Mail news articles with their summarized bullet points, and show that a neural network can then be trained to give good performance on this task. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of this new reading comprehension task. Our primary aim is to understand what depth of language understanding is required to do well on this task. We approach this from one side by doing a careful hand-analysis of a small subset of the problems and from the other by showing that simple, carefully designed systems can obtain accuracies of 72.4% and 75.8% on these two datasets, exceeding current state-of-the-art results by over 5% and approaching what we believe is the ceiling for performance on this task.</p>

<h4>The task and the datasets</h4>

<pre><code>reading comprehension: passage (P) + question (Q) =&gt; answer (A)
data is a bottleneck
existing datasets very small
last year, DeepMind (Hermann et al. 2015) created a very large dataset from CNN/Daily Mail
~1M examples
</code></pre>

<p><img src="danqi-1.png" alt="danqi-1.png" title="" /></p>

<p><img src="danqi-2.png" alt="danqi-2.png" title="" /></p>

<pre><code>this paper
lower bound: simple systems work surprisingly well on this dataset
upper bound: manual analysis indicates that we are almost done -- this task is not that hard!
</code></pre>

<h4>Establishing stronger baselines with simple models</h4>

<pre><code>system 1: simple entity-centric classifier with manually-engineered features
  for each entity, build vector of very simple features
system 2: end-to-end NN: bi-RNN w/ attention -- nowadays a pretty standard architecture
</code></pre>

<p><img src="danqi-3.png" alt="danqi-3.png" title="" /></p>

<p><img src="danqi-4.png" alt="danqi-4.png" title="" /></p>

<pre><code>results
  baselines: Hermann et al. 2015 (DeepMind), Hill et al. 2016 (Facebook)
  our simple classifier matches best previous results
  our NN does even better
  ensemble of the two does even better! 77% accuracy
</code></pre>

<p><img src="danqi-5.png" alt="danqi-5.png" title="" /></p>

<pre><code>why do we get much better results than DeepMind's attentive reader?
  bilinear attention
  remove a redundant layer before prediction
  predict among entities only, not all words
</code></pre>

<h4>Assessing headroom via manual analysis</h4>

<pre><code>upper bound
do ablation analysis of our simple classifier
  most important feature is n-gram match, followed by frequency
manual breakdown of examples into six categories
  exact match, paraphrasing, partial clue, multiple sentences, coreference error, ambiguous/hard
  the last two categories are going to be very hard to get, but constitute 25% of examples
  we're already at 77% performance -- already close to ceiling
</code></pre>

<p><img src="danqi-6.png" alt="danqi-6.png" title="" /></p>

<pre><code>takeaways
  simple models sometimes just work
  NNs great for learning semantic matches
  dataset is large, but still noisy, not hard enough for reasoning and inference
  more datasets coming: WikiReading, LAMBADA, SQuAD
  it's an exciting time for reading comprehension!

<p>Learning Language Games through Interaction <br />

<p>Abstract: <br />
We introduce a new language learning setting relevant to building adaptive natural language interfaces. It is inspired by Wittgensteinâs language games: a human wishes to accomplish some task (e.g., achieving a certain configuration of blocks), but can only communicate with a computer, who performs the actual actions (e.g., removing all red blocks). The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computerâs capabilities.  We created a game called SHRDLURN in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humansâ strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance.  Second, we compare computer strategies, showing that modeling pragmatics on a semantic parsing model accelerates learning for more strategic players.</p>

<pre><code>natural language interfaces: SIri, Cortana, Google Now, Alexa
NLI wishlist
  interactive learning -- feedback from users
  adapt to users
  handle special domains and low resource languages

language game -- Wittgenstein
  language derives its meaning from use
interactive language game
  human player has goal, cannot perform actions
  computer player does not know goal, can performa actions, does not understand the language

SHRDLURN
  blocks world
  starting configuration, goal
  "remove red"
  computer responds with ordered list of actions
  human provides feedback by choosing correct action
  "remove right red"
  built a nice UI for this

<pre><code>computer: semantic parsing
actions as logical forms
fairly standard approach to semantic parsing
  log-linear model, L1 penalty, AdaGrad
  very generic features: uni-, bi-, skip-grams; tree-grams, cross-product features

humans: 100 MTurkers
10K utterances (6 hours)
minimal instructions
can use any language
examples
  some invented their own shortahnd language
  some were inconsistent, performed poorly
  most used English, but one used Polish, one used RPN!
  became more consistent, more concise over time
  learning works fairly well, esp. for top players
</code></pre>

<p><img src="shrdlurn-3.png" alt="shrdlurn-3.png" title="" /></p>

<pre><code>pragmatics
  say you teach the computer the meaning of one word
  if you then use a different word, pragmatics suggests that you mean a different thing
  otherwise you should have just used the same word
  humans do this without thinking
  reminiscent of work from Will Monroe and Chris Potts
  but adding pragmatics had relatively little impact on quantitative results overall
  however that includes crappy players
  if you focus only on the top players, it does help a lot!

takeaways
  more capable and responsive to users
  feedback mechanism =&gt; less likely to be stuck
  good for low-resource languages and new domains
  learn from the actual distribution

<p><em>The Enemy in Your Own Camp: How Well Can We Detect Statistically-Generated Fake Reviews -- An Adversarial Study</em> <br />
Dirk Hovy <br />
<a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2057.pdf">http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2057.pdf</a></p>

<p>Abstract: <br />
Online reviews are a growing market, but it is struggling with fake reviews. They undermine both the value of reviews to the user, and their trust in the review sites.  However, fake positive reviews can boost a business, and so a small industry producing fake reviews has developed. The two sides are facing an arms race that involves more and more natural language processing (NLP). So far, NLP has been used mostly for detection, and works well on human-generated reviews. But what happens if NLP techniques are used to generate fake reviews as well? We investigate the question in an adversarial setup, by assessing the detectability of different fake-review generation strategies. We use generative models to produce reviews based on meta-information, and evaluate their effectiveness against deceptiondetection models and human judges. We find that meta-information helps detection, but that NLP-generated reviews conditioned on such information are also much harder to detect than conventional ones.</p>

<p>Somebody stole Dirk's laptop, so he had to present without slides! Kicking it old-school! Heroic!</p>

<p><img src="IMG_1727.JPG" alt="Dirk Hovy" title="" /></p>

<pre><code>lots of reviews -- Yelp, Trip Advisor
a multi-billion dollar industry
problem of fake reviews
companies are using NLP to identify fake reviews
we're actually able to do this pretty well
fake reviewers are lazy
too many adjectives
can use a logistic regression model pretty well
if we can detect fake reviews using NLP, can we make fake reviews using NLP
7-gram Markov model works really well
now, can we detect those?
turns out that fake detectors also use metadata extensively -- age, gender
so to make good fakes, you have to fake the metadata too
a generative model for that
adversarial setup
how well can NLP tools fool NLP tools
if you don't generate fake metadata, the LR model can discriminate the fakes
but if you do, it can't distinguish the fakes!
how well do humans do? terrible -- worse than logistic regression models
so this is how you can get rich quick

<p>Deep multi-task learning with low level tasks supervised at lower layers <br />
Anders SÃ¸gaard and Yoav Goldberg <br />
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-2038.pdf</p>

<p>Abstract: <br />
In all previous work on deep multi-task learning we are aware of, all task supervisions are on the same (outermost) layer.  We present a multi-task learning architecture with deep bi-directional RNNs, where different tasks supervision can happen at different layers. We present experiments in syntactic chunking and CCG supertagging, coupled with the additional task of POS-tagging. We show that it is consistently better to have POS supervision at the innermost rather than the outermost layer. We argue that this is because âlow-levelâ tasks are better kept at the lower layers, enabling the higher-level tasks to make use of the shared representation of the lower-level tasks. Finally, we also show how this architecture can be used for domain adaptation.</p>

<pre><code>bi-LSTM models
input layer: pretrained embeddings
output layers: syntactic chunking, or POS tagging (multi-task learning)
during training, we randomly sample from the two datasets, then randomly sample an example

three perspectives on multi-task learning
1 semi-supervised learning
    auxiliary data is enriched unlabeled data
2 representation learning
    auxiliary data is used to learn representations that are useful for target task
3 regularization
    auxiliary data is an adaptive prior

inspiration: face recognition, preogressively more complex repns at higher layers
idea: use POS data to supervise at lower layers, not top layer
instead of supervising with either POS or syntax at top output layer

experiments
baseline vs. vanilla MTL vs cascaded
yes, cascaded helps!

more experiments
domain adaptation
assume we have POS-annotated data for target domain, but not SYN-annotated data
here the effect is even more pronounced

MTL as regularization
is supervision at lower layers more prone to overfitting?
no, in fact it is less vulnerable to overfitting than baseline or vanilla MTL

take home messages
MTL is cool
NNs provide a convenient framework for MTL
but think about your architectures

<p>Finding Non-Arbitrary Form-Meaning Systematicity Using String-Metric Learning for Kernel Regression <br />
E. Dario Gutierrez, Roger Levy and Benjamin Bergen <br />
<a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1225.pdf">https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1225.pdf</a></p>

<p>Abstract: <br />
Arbitrariness of the sign â the notion that the forms of words are unrelated to their meanings â is an underlying assumption of many linguistic theories. Two lines of research have recently challenged this assumption, but they produce differing characterizations of non-arbitrariness in language.  Behavioral and corpus studies have confirmed the validity of localized form-meaning patterns manifested in limited subsets of the lexicon. Meanwhile, global (lexicon-wide) statistical analyses instead find diffuse form-meaning systematicity across the lexicon as a whole.  We bridge the gap with an approach that can detect both local and global form-meaning systematicity in language. In the kernel regression formulation we introduce, form-meaning relationships can be used to predict wordsâ distributional semantic vectors from their forms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel metric learning algorithm that can learn weighted edit distances that minimize kernel regression error. Our results suggest that the English lexicon exhibits far more global form-meaning systematicity than previously discovered, and that much of this systematicity is focused in localized form-meaning patterns.</p>

<h4>My raw notes</h4>

<pre><code>arbitrariness of the sign
assumption: the relationship between forms and meanings is arbitrary
but is it so?

systematicity in the lexicon
sub-morphemic form-mean mappings
  buzz, clink, clank
  gl: gleam, glow, glimmer, glint, glance, glare, glisten, glitter, ...
  sn: snark, sneeze, sniff, snicker, ...
  sl: slide, slick, sled
identified intuitively
confirmed empirically
but relies on testing specific hypotheses
can we automate this?
can we study systematicity globally?
maybe these are just statistically flukes?
how broadly distributed over the lexicon?

let's use distributional semantics to study systematicity over the whole lexicon
Shillock &amp; Kirby 2001
  over all pairs of words, measure correlation between form distances and meaning distances
  the correlation is small in magnitude, but highly statistically significant
Monaghan et al. 2014 -- found no difference from chance
how to reconcile?
maybe previous work is not sensitive enough
  only capture linear relationships
  treat all types of edits as equivalent

can we learn a model from string space into semantic space?
  SMLKR model
  i.e. try to predict meaning from form?
  kernel regression -- non-parametric regression -- locally smooth
  metric learning for kernel regression
  parametrization of edit distance function space
  optimization

experiments
  40,000 words, most frequent in BNC corpus
  found highly statistically significant structure
  most systematic: gurgle, tingle, hoop, chink, swirl, ladle, ...
